## Project Overview

We are building a **Personalized Learning Path Recommender** system that analyzes a learner's profile to suggest tailored learning paths for mastering technical fields such as AI, Data Science, and Web Development. Our solution will make it easier for individuals to map out their learning journey and improve their skills efficiently.

### Problem Statement:

Create a system or web app that personalizes learning paths for users based on their prior knowledge and goals in fields like AI, Data Science, or Web Development.

### Core Features:

-   **Profile Creation**: Users can create profiles and input data about their knowledge, interests, and learning goals.
-   **Recommendation System**: An AI-driven algorithm will suggest personalized learning paths tailored to the user’s specific needs.
-   **Progress Tracking**: The system will track users' progress, helping them stay on track and update recommendations.
-   **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive web application that allows users to easily interact with the system.

## Our Tech Stack

We’re using the following tools and technologies to build our solution:

-   **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-   **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
-   **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
-   **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
-   **Deployment**: Heroku, Docker

## Roadmap

We have a clear plan of action to make sure we deliver our solution on time. Here’s a quick look at our roadmap:

-   **Phase 1**: Idea conceptualization and team formation
-   **Phase 2**: Designing the profile system and database schema
-   **Phase 3**: Developing the recommendation algorithm
-   **Phase 4**: Building the frontend web interface
-   **Phase 5**: Integration and testing
-   **Phase 6**: Final submission and presentation
